                                <p>Over the last few weeks, I've been thinking of a website that
                                    could be used as a resource for web development. I've developed a lot of websites
                                    over the years,
                                    but a vast majority of those sites have been client work. I’ve not taken the time in
                                    between to do something that would work for me. Beginning with this website, I'll be
                                    creating something for myself. However, within this creation, I hope to do one thing
                                </p>

                                <h2>Consistently challenge myself.</h2>
                                <h3>Front-end Framework</h3>
                                <p>I decided to forgo using a front-end framework. It’s been five years since I last
                                    built a site from the ground up. Switching to frameworks became a necessity. It was
                                    a painstaking process to build a responsive website without one in 2014. Now that
                                    CSS Grid and Flexbox are widely supported, they’ve become slightly less relevant, at
                                    least when it comes to developing my own website. I’m still more than happy to
                                    integrate Bootstrap, Foundation, Bulma, etc. if it’s called for.</p>
                                <h3>Website Design</h3>
                                <p>Once I decided I would not be using a framework, I then had to decide how to design
                                    the website. Photoshop? Sure, that has been a standard for a long time. However,
                                    there is other software out there, dedicated specifically for website layout. I did
                                    some research and came across InVision Studio. It’s not the only one, Adobe has its
                                    own called Adobe XD, but I wanted to be a little less reliant on yet another Adobe
                                    product - if only to see what other software developers had going on. I’m pleasantly
                                    surprised with just how simple and easy it is to develop a mockup and turn it into a
                                    website.
                                    Granted, the site I’ve designed isn’t the most complex, but, baby steps.</p>
                                <h3>Content Management</h3>
                                <p>With the front-end framework and design out of the way, I had to decide on the
                                    platform. Wordpress! Just kidding. I love Wordpress, I’ve been using it since 2009,
                                    but the goal was to challenge myself. I couldn’t possibly use Wordpress. That would
                                    be too easy. My initial attempt was with Hugo CMS. It’s not a bad CMS and very
                                    different in how it functions from Wordpress, but ultimately, I decided against it.
                                    I wanted full control and while technically you have that with any CMS, I wanted to
                                    start fresh.</p>
                                <p>Everything you see is being managed on my computer. There is no true CMS or back-end
                                    to speak of. How is that possible? Welcome to…</p>
                                <h3>Task Runners, Git & Netlify</h3>
                                <p>These deserve a post on their own, so I won’t go into technical details but each one
                                    is an amazing piece of technology that makes my life a while lot easier. Gulp (task
                                    runner) speeds up my development process. Git manages all my changes and stores them
                                    online. If I ever need to go back to a previous version, I can. Netlify does the
                                    hosting…for free! They even provide a free SSL certificate to top it off among a lot
                                    of other features I’ve yet to try. Admittedly, I’ve been using task runners and Git
                                    for a while now. I’ve just not fully integrated them into my process like I have
                                    with this website.</p>
                                <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
                                <p>I have a lot more coming down the pipeline. I’ll be integrating JavaScript, but I’ve
                                    left it out at the time of this post as it wasn’t needed for the initial push. I’ll
                                    also be working more with Codepen and adding useful snippets of code. Finally, if
                                    you’re interested, you can fork this website and use it as a building block for your
                                    own.</p>
